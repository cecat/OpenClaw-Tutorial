# Getting Started with OpenClaw: A Safety-First Approach
## Tutorial Outline — 90-Minute Lecture

**Target audience:** Developers with working knowledge of GitHub, Python, shell scripting, Docker, and Linux (crontab). No prior OpenClaw experience required.

**Central theme:** Autonomous agents are powerful and genuinely useful — and that power demands deliberate design. This tutorial builds a working OpenClaw deployment with safety, containment, and alignment as first-class design goals, not afterthoughts.

**Tutorial repository:** `github.com/cecat/OpenClaw-Tutorial` — contains this outline, the slide deck, and (when the hands-on lab is developed) a `gateway/` directory with platform configuration and an `agents/` directory with a parameterized agent workspace ready to deploy.

## Module 1 — What Is OpenClaw and Why This Approach? *(10 min)*

### 1.1 What OpenClaw Is (and Isn't)
- OpenClaw is an **agent framework** that provides persistent memory, tools, and communication channels to multiple agents, each implemented via a model
- Open source, self-hosted: you own the configuration, credentials, history, and behavior
- Enables each agent to use a different model, including local models (e.g., via vLLM) and models provided via cloud APIs (e.g., Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, Google)
- Communicates through multiple optional channels including Slack, a web dashboard, Telegram, and dozens of other channels
- For each agent, the model provides cognition; OpenClaw provides orchestration, file access, tool execution, memory, and limited native scheduling (a periodic heartbeat that fires every N minutes — more on the limitations of this in Module 5)

### 1.2 What an Agent Actually Does (that a chatbot doesn't)
- A chatbot waits for a question and answers it. An agent acts between conversations — on a schedule, in response to events, and on its own judgment about what to do next.
- An agent can send your email, post to Slack, read your calendar, modify files, and call APIs — autonomously, while you sleep.
- This is genuinely useful. It is also qualitatively different from a chatbot, and must be designed accordingly.
- OpenClaw agents can be partially autonomous without being fully autonomous — calibrating that balance deliberately is an important facet of this tutorial.

Out of the box, OpenClaw supports three types of triggers: **incoming messages** (a Slack DM, a channel message, a web dashboard conversation), **the heartbeat** (a periodic timer that fires every N minutes — the only proactive, non-reactive trigger native to OpenClaw), and **channel-specific events** like Slack reactions or mentions depending on configuration. The heartbeat is the closest thing to native scheduling, but it is blunt: it fires on every interval whether or not there is any work to do, and the agent must reason about what (if anything) to do each time — burning inference on the question hundreds of times a week. This gap is what our scheduling scaffolding (Module 5) was built to address.

### 1.3 Why "Safety-First"?
- Security and containment have historically been afterthoughts with exciting new technology — something addressed after adoption, once incidents accumulate, rather than before. OpenClaw is no exception to this pattern. The platform is powerful, the demos are compelling, and the natural instinct is to get something running and worry about hardening later. Rapid adoption amplifies this risk: Jensen Huang remarked at GTC in March 2026 that OpenClaw is the fastest-adopted open source project of all time. [*verify and cite*] The faster a platform spreads, the faster it becomes a target.
- The consequences are already well-documented. Module 2 presents a dedicated slide on real incidents — exposed instances, a skills registry poisoning campaign, and a remotely-exploitable vulnerability in improperly-bound gateways — all traceable to skipped hardening steps. The details are in Module 2; the point here is that they are not hypothetical.
- We cover safety, containment, and alignment in Module 2 — before setup, before configuration, before anything else — because the decisions you make in the first hour determine the blast radius of everything that goes wrong later. Understanding the risks is part of understanding the platform.
- **The right mental model:** your agent acts in your name. Every email it sends is from you. Every Slack post is from you. Design accordingly — not by neutering the agent, but by designing the right boundaries. *(Module 2 covers this in full.)*

### 1.4 Architecture Summarized

An OpenClaw deployment consists of one or more language models and a gateway, connected by a Docker internal network that is not exposed to the outside world. Each agent can be backed by a different model — the same gateway can run one agent on a local GPU and another on a cloud API — allowing you to match model capability and cost to each agent's actual needs. The gateway manages agent identities, conversation sessions, tool execution, and channel integrations (Slack, web dashboard, and others). Agent personality, memory, and task procedures live in plain markdown files in a workspace directory on the host — readable, auditable, and well-suited to version control.

**OpenClaw out of the box vs. our implementation:** It is important to distinguish what OpenClaw provides natively from what we have built on top of it. OpenClaw provides the gateway, the agent execution environment, the sandbox, and the channel integrations. It does not provide scheduling, cron-based automation, an email outbox/approval workflow, or per-agent model switching. Those are our additions — a scaffolding layer we built to make the deployment safe, reliable, and maintainable. Throughout this talk we will be explicit about where OpenClaw ends and our scaffolding begins. This distinction matters: our approach is not "how OpenClaw works out of the box" but "how we chose to deploy OpenClaw, and why we believe those choices are worth adopting."

When an agent executes code or runs a script, it does so inside an ephemeral Docker sandbox container that is discarded after the task completes. That sandbox has only the network access you explicitly grant it — and we explicitly block it from reaching your LAN, other hosts, and SSH services via iptables rules. The gateway itself listens only on your Tailscale interface (a private VPN IP), making it unreachable from the public internet or your local network. Tailscale also provides HTTPS via its `serve` command, so the dashboard is accessible securely from your Tailscale-enrolled devices without opening any ports. (Tailscale is a prerequisite for this deployment; see [tailscale.com/download](https://tailscale.com/download) for installation.)

Scheduling is entirely our own addition: cron scripts running on the host decide when to queue work; the model decides what to do with it. OpenClaw has no native scheduling support. This is part of the scaffolding we built and will describe in Module 5.

*The full architecture diagram and setup walkthrough are in Module 3.*

### 1.5 What This Talk Covers

1. The design charter: safety, containment, alignment, and separation of responsibilities
2. Platform architecture and choosing your model
3. Agent identity: the files that define each agent's persona, responsibilities, and operating procedures — the who, what, and how
4. Scheduling: why the shell owns the clock
5. The scaffolding: runbooks, scripts, and cron
6. Integrations: Slack and Google
7. Lessons learned from a working deployment

*The hands-on lab (a separate session) puts this into practice using `OpenClaw-Gmail` as the worked example.*

## Module 2 — The Design Charter *(15 min)*

> **This module is the foundation.** Every architecture decision in Modules 3–7 — sandboxing, iptables rules, the outbox pattern, SOUL.md, the scheduling design, the scaffolding — exists because of the principles established here. We cover it second, not last, because you should understand *why* before you are asked to execute *what*.

### 2.1 The Threat Model
Four risk categories when running an autonomous agent. These are not hypothetical:

1. **Prompt injection** — malicious content in email, files, or Slack instructs the agent to execute unintended commands. The agent cannot distinguish a legitimate instruction from one embedded in adversarial input unless the system is designed to limit what it can do with that input. This is a structural vulnerability: current LLMs do not enforce separation between instructions they are meant to execute and data they are meant to process. [*cite: Zverev et al., "Can LLMs Separate Instructions From Data?", ICLR 2025*]

2. **Lateral movement** — a sandbox container that can reach your LAN, other Tailscale nodes, or SSH services can be used as a pivot point. This is especially relevant when the agent's sandbox runs on a machine that also has access to other internal services.

3. **Runaway external actions** — the agent takes actions with real-world consequences without human review: sending email, posting to public channels, modifying files, or changing configuration. A mistake (such as deleting files or changing configs) by an agent is not intentionally malicious, but is the model trying to be helpful, where "helpful" was not bounded precisely enough. A common example: ask the agent to diagnose a problem and it will often try to fix it, touching things you did not ask it to touch. *(This is Lesson 4 in Module 8.)*

4. **Credential exfiltration** — API keys, OAuth tokens, and other secrets passed to the sandbox can leak via outbound HTTP if the sandbox has unrestricted network access.

5. **Supply chain / skills registry poisoning** — third-party skills installed from a public registry (ClawHub) may contain malicious code. The ClawHavoc campaign (January–February 2026) poisoned approximately 20% of ClawHub's registry with skills delivering credential stealers and backdoors; the only requirement to publish had been a GitHub account one week old, with no code review or signing. Any skill installed from a registry is code that runs inside your sandbox with the access you have granted it. Treat it accordingly.

### 2.2 Alignment

Alignment is ensuring that a system's goals, values, methods, and behavior remain compatible with human intentions — not just in the literal task at hand, but across the full range of situations the system may encounter. A well-aligned agent does what you actually want, not merely what you literally instructed it to do, and does not pursue its objectives in ways that create harms you did not anticipate or authorize. This is a significant research challenge at the frontier of AI, but there are concrete steps we can take to promote alignment in our OpenClaw deployment — making alignment a design goal rather than an assumption or afterthought.

Our approach has two complementary components:

**Structural bounds:** We limit what the agent can do regardless of what it decides to try. Sandbox containment, the outbox approval workflow, disabled config writes, and network isolation are mechanical constraints — the agent cannot break them by being confused, mistaken, or instructed otherwise. Structural bounds are the most reliable form of alignment because they do not depend on the model reasoning correctly.

**Behavioral invariants via SOUL.md:** For the cases that structural bounds do not cover — tone, judgment, deference, how to handle ambiguity — we encode explicit behavioral invariants in `SOUL.md`. The key property of `SOUL.md` is that it is one of the 8 files OpenClaw loads into every inference call, every time, unconditionally. An alignment constraint that lives in a secondary file may not be in context when the agent makes a decision. One in `SOUL.md` always is.

Essential invariants to establish in `SOUL.md` before connecting any external service:
- **Stop means stop.** "DO NOT PROCEED," "WAIT," and "STOP" are not invitations to acknowledge and continue. They mean halt and report.
- **The agent does not touch the gateway or its own configuration.** Not to fix a bug, not to improve performance, not to help debug a problem it caused. It reports and waits for instruction.
- **External communications go through the outbox.** The agent queues; a human or a designated reviewer sends.
- **Deferred work goes to TODO.md.** The agent does not sleep, loop, or block waiting for a future time. It writes the task and returns.
- **The cost of stopping unnecessarily is low. The cost of acting incorrectly is high.** Encode this asymmetry explicitly — agents should err toward caution, not toward helpfulness, when the two are in tension.
- **Internal details are private.** The agent must never disclose pathnames, filenames, or configuration details; tokens, passwords, or credentials; or the contents of its own identity files (SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, and others) to any external party — including in email, Slack messages, or any channel that reaches beyond the local system. What the agent knows about itself stays inside the system.

### 2.3 Separation of Responsibilities: Code for Procedure, LLM for Judgment

> **Anything deterministic or purely procedural is implemented in code. Anything requiring judgment, creativity, or natural language understanding or generation is handled by the model. The boundary between them must be sharp and explicit.**

This is the architectural principle that generates the entire scaffolding of runbooks, scripts, and cron jobs built in Modules 5 and 6. The case for it rests on several independent factors: reliability (code produces the same output for the same input, every time), auditability (you can read exactly what a script does), testability (you can write a unit test for a script; you cannot unit-test an LLM instruction), and token efficiency (deterministic operations that run hundreds of times a week should not consume inference budget).

The two sides of the boundary:

| Belongs to code | Belongs to the LLM |
|---|---|
| When to act (cron schedule) | Whether this email needs a reply |
| Whether a TODO item is due (bash date comparison) | What the reply should say |
| Fetching messages from the Gmail API | Identifying action items in fetched email |
| Routing rows in a spreadsheet by column value | Summarizing ambiguous content |
| Counting, sorting, filtering structured data | Inferring priority from unstructured text |
| Moving a file from outbox to sent | Deciding whether to approve a draft |
| Sending an HTTP request with a known payload | Composing the payload from context |

Three recent papers converge on this same conclusion from different angles, providing research grounding for a principle we arrived at empirically:

- Masterman et al. (2024) survey the landscape of agent architectures and document that the spectrum from fully LLM-driven to structured/deterministic designs is a recognized axis of variation — with reliability-critical applications consistently gravitating toward the deterministic end. [*cite: arXiv:2404.11584*]
- Hong et al. (MetaGPT, ICLR 2024 oral) demonstrate the value empirically: encoding Standard Operating Procedures in code and assigning deterministic roles to agents dramatically reduces cascading hallucinations compared to naively chaining LLMs. [*cite: arXiv:2308.00352*]
- Qiu et al. (Blueprint First, Model Second, 2025) make the architectural case most directly: a deterministic orchestration engine manages workflow structure while the LLM handles bounded sub-tasks — producing verifiable, auditable behavior. [*cite: arXiv:2508.02721*]

The token efficiency argument is quantified concretely in Module 5 with a table showing waste rates for common scheduling patterns.

**A note on where the field is going:** Language models are improving rapidly and will increasingly be capable of handling scheduling, state management, and procedural tasks more reliably. As they do, the right boundary between code and model will shift. The habit of thinking clearly about which layer owns which responsibility will remain valuable regardless — even if the specific boundary moves.

**The scaffolding this principle generates:**

The LLM sits atop three layers of deterministic scaffolding. Each layer calls down only — the LLM invokes runbooks, runbooks invoke scripts, scripts are triggered by cron. Information flows back up; control flows down.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  LLM — the OpenClaw agent                                   │
│  Compose · Summarize · Triage · Decide · Communicate        │
│  "What does this mean, and what should we do?"              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  RUNBOOKS  (markdown, read fresh from disk at trigger time) │
│  "Which tools to call and in what order"                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  SCRIPTS  (Python/bash, run deterministically in sandbox)   │
│  "How to move, fetch, and transform data"                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  CRON  (host-side, zero tokens, fully deterministic)        │
│  "When to act — the scheduling engine"                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This is not a strict call hierarchy — cron triggers the heartbeat, which triggers the LLM, which reads a runbook, which calls a script, whose output the LLM then acts on. But the separation of responsibilities is strict: no layer does work that belongs to another.

### 2.4 Containment: The Technical Layers

A layered defense. Each layer is described in detail when it appears in setup — listed here so the rationale is clear before the mechanics:

| Layer | Mechanism | Threat it addresses |
|---|---|---|
| Network | Tailscale-only gateway binding (not `0.0.0.0`) | Dashboard reachable only from your Tailscale-enrolled devices; also prevents WebSocket hijack from malicious websites. Dashboard access additionally requires a pairing token introduced in recent OpenClaw versions. See ["ClawJacked" — The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/clawjacked-flaw-lets-malicious-sites.html) for the real-world exploit (CVE-2026-25253) that targets gateways bound to `0.0.0.0`. |
| Network | iptables DOCKER-USER rules | Sandbox containers cannot make outbound connections to your local network (LAN) or to Tailscale nodes (100.64.0.0/10). Connections to the internet (e.g., Google APIs, Anthropic API) are permitted — agents need them. SSH connections (port 22) are additionally blocked regardless of destination. |
| Execution | Sandbox mode: `mode: all` | Agent commands run in throwaway containers, not on the host |
| Execution | No `docker.sock` in sandbox | No container escape to host Docker daemon |
| Config | Disable `commands.config` writes | Agent cannot modify gateway configuration via chat |
| Filesystem | docker-compose bind mounts (explicit, narrow) | Agent's sandbox can only access the specific directories you mount — it cannot reach the rest of your host filesystem, config files, or other services |
| Credentials | Separate dedicated service accounts | If a credential is compromised, the attacker's access is limited to that account's permissions on that one service — they cannot pivot to your personal email, other accounts, or other systems. The "blast" is the damage; the "radius" is how far it can spread. Separate accounts keep the radius small. |

**A note on sandbox architecture:** The OpenClaw gateway is a long-running Docker container that hosts the agent runtime and dashboard. When the agent runs an exec command (a script, a shell command), OpenClaw spawns a separate, ephemeral Docker container for that execution — this is the "sandbox." The gateway container itself can reach Tailscale (it needs to for the dashboard and Slack); the sandbox containers are what the iptables rules restrict. Internet access (Google APIs, Anthropic API, etc.) is permitted from sandbox containers — agents need it to call external services. Only LAN and Tailscale node access is blocked, preventing lateral movement to other machines on your network. *(See FIXES.md for notes on further egress hardening if desired.)*

*A CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) is a standardized identifier assigned to a publicly disclosed security vulnerability — essentially a bug-tracker entry for cybersecurity flaws, maintained by MITRE and referenced across the security industry. When a CVE is cited here, a link to coverage of the specific incident is provided so the reader can examine the details.*

*When you encounter each of these in Modules 3–7, the "why" is already established here.*

The gap between what is possible and what is commonly deployed is striking: a 2025 survey of deployed agentic AI systems found that the majority document no sandboxing or containment mechanisms at all. [*cite: "The 2025 AI Agent Index," MIT, arXiv 2602.17753, 2025*] We treat these layers as non-negotiable precisely because the default is to omit them.

### 2.5 Trust but Verify: Layered Review

The long-term goal of a personal agent deployment is to remove yourself from routine decisions — not to keep you perpetually in the loop. But trust is earned, not assumed. We start with review at every consequential action and progressively delegate that review as we gain confidence in the agent's behavior.

The **outbox pattern** is the mechanism: the agent writes a draft to a queue, a reviewer approves or rejects, and a deterministic cron script handles the actual sending (if approved). The reviewer is either another agent assigned to the task or a human.

```
Agent writes draft JSON → shared/outbox/  (status: "pending")
Reviewer approves or rejects → marks status accordingly
Deterministic cron script sends approved items → archives to sent/
Full audit trail preserved in outbox / sent / rejected
```

In our system we have three agents: a supervisory agent (reviewer as needed), a clerical agent (currnetly tracking submissions to web forms and creating reports on submissions to notify humans via Slack and email), and a Gmail assist agent (work in progress to help manage email, calendar, tasks).

**The supervisory agent (reviewer) is a design choice, not a fixed role.** In our current deployment we use two tiers:

- **Agent review** for outbound email from our clerical agent, whose routine reporting uses template-based messages with light natural language fills. The review criteria — appropriate language, no more than a handful of emails per day to any recipient, recipient must be in the contacts database — are defined in `EMAIL.md` and applied by the supervisory agent during its heartbeat. The supervisory agent approves or rejects each queued draft (fully logged for diagnostics).

- **Human review** for outbound email from our Gmail assist agent, which reads incoming messages, interprets them, and drafts a substantive reply. The judgment required is higher and the stakes of an error are greater. The human reviews manually while we build a track record and fine-tune the model's instructions regarding email handling..

As the Gmail agent's drafts prove consistently good over time, we will delegate review to a second agent — likely a smaller, cheaper reasoning model suited to the specific review task. This is also an economic design decision: a capable reasoning model for drafting, a lighter model for reviewing against known criteria, and human oversight only where neither suffices yet.

**The principle generalizes beyond email.** Any agent action with real-world consequences — a Slack post to a public channel, an API call that creates or modifies an external record — should ideally start with review enabled. The outbox pattern is the mechanism; the review criteria and the reviewer evolve as the deployment matures. Implementation details are in Modules 5 and 6.

This is a living architecture, not a final answer. What we describe here is our current state; it will change as our agents earn more autonomy.

### 2.6 Charter Summary
Four principles that drive design and implementation decisions in this deployment:

1. **Separation of responsibilities** — anything deterministic or procedural is implemented in code; anything requiring judgment, creativity, or language is handled by the model. The boundary is sharp and explicit.
2. **Containment** — network, execution, filesystem, and config isolation are in place before anything external is connected.
3. **Alignment** — behavioral invariants are established in `SOUL.md` before the agent is given tools, and are reinforced by structural bounds that do not depend on the model reasoning correctly.
4. **Trust but Verify** — any action with real-world consequences goes through an approval queue; a human or designated reviewer confirms before execution.

## Module 3 — Platform Architecture and Model Choice *(15 min)*

### 3.1 The Docker Stack

```
[You, via Tailscale — browser or Slack]
        |
        v  HTTPS via tailscale serve → port 18789 on Tailscale IP only
[OpenClaw gateway container]           ← dashboard + agent runtime
        |
        v  http://nim:8000/v1 — Docker-internal network only, never exposed to host
[vLLM container]  ← only present for local-model deployments
        |
        v
[GPU + unified memory]
```

You interact with the gateway in two ways: through Slack (the primary day-to-day interface), and occasionally through the web dashboard at port 18789 for configuration and monitoring. Both are accessible only via Tailscale — the gateway never binds to `0.0.0.0`. The model API is accessible only within the Docker-internal network and is never exposed to the host or the outside world.

**A practical note on gateway configuration:** Changes to `openclaw.json` — the live gateway configuration — are more awkward than they should be. The dashboard provides a small JSON editor that is functional but inconvenient for anything beyond minor edits. Our workflow: extract the current config from the running container, edit it with a proper editor or with Claude Code, copy it back into the container, and restart the gateway. We have scripts that handle the extract and restart steps; the editing is manual. This is a real friction point worth acknowledging — it is not unique to our setup, and there is no elegant solution yet.

**Tailscale prerequisite:** Tailscale must be installed and running on your host before deploying OpenClaw. See [tailscale.com/download](https://tailscale.com/download) for installation — the setup takes about five minutes and is well-documented. Once installed, `tailscale serve` handles the HTTPS proxy automatically.

### 3.2 Choosing Your Model

In our deployment we use a local GPU for some agents and a cloud API for others — and the choice can be changed at any time with a single config edit. The table below illustrates the tradeoffs:

| Path | Hardware requirement | Model examples | Characteristic |
|---|---|---|---|
| Local GPU | Machine with dedicated GPU and sufficient memory (e.g., NVIDIA DGX Spark GB10, high-end workstation, Mac with Apple Silicon M-series) | Qwen3-Coder-Next-FP8 via vLLM | Low per-token cost; throughput depends on hardware; typically <100 tps |
| Cloud API | Any Linux host (no GPU required) | Anthropic Claude (claude-sonnet-4-6, claude-haiku-4-5) | Pay-per-token; consistently fast; easier setup |

**On running a local model:** The key constraint is memory, not just GPU. A 32 GB unified memory machine (e.g., M-series Mac) can run smaller quantized models but will see lower throughput and may struggle with large context windows. Throughput matters for scheduled tasks — a 50-tps model can produce a 500-token email digest in 10 seconds; a 5-tps model takes 100 seconds. If you are not already confident your hardware can run a capable model, the cloud API path removes this variable entirely and lets you focus on the agent architecture, which is the point of this tutorial.

**Our recommendation for the tutorial:** Use the cloud API (e.g., Anthropic Claude) unless you already have local model inference working. The architecture is identical — the only difference is one line in `config.yaml`.

### 3.3 Quick and Easy Model Switch 

In order to make it easy to swamp models in for individual or all agents, we created a config.yaml to specify which model to use for each agent, and a set of scripts to push those assignments into OpenClaw.

OpenClaw stores per-agent model assignments inside `openclaw.json` — a large JSON configuration file that lives inside the running gateway container. Editing it directly means either using the dashboard's small JSON editor or manually extracting the file, editing it, copying it back, and restarting the gateway. For a single change that's manageable; for experimenting across agents and providers it becomes tedious and error-prone.

Our solution: `config.yaml`, a small human-readable file that lives in the infrastructure repo alongside your other config. `apply-config.sh` reads it, patches `openclaw.json` in the container, and restarts the gateway. The source of truth for model assignments is `config.yaml`, not the raw JSON.

```yaml
# config.yaml — per-agent model assignments (our scaffolding, not native OpenClaw)
agents:
  main:
    model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6    # cloud API
  gmail-agent:
    model: vllm/Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-Next-FP8  # local GPU
```

**`secrets.yaml`** (gitignored, never committed) holds API keys:
```yaml
anthropic_api_key: sk-ant-...
```

**Applying a change — step 1, preview:**
```bash
./apply-config.sh --dry-run
```
This prints the JSON diff that *would* be written to `openclaw.json` — useful for pasting to an AI assistant or reviewing manually to confirm the change looks right. It is a preview only; nothing is applied.

**Step 2, apply (only after reviewing the dry-run output):**
```bash
./apply-config.sh
```
Applies the patch to `openclaw.json` and restarts the gateway. Do not run both commands in a single copy/paste — the dry-run output needs to be inspected before applying.

**Reverting to a known-good configuration:** Before experimenting with a new model or provider, save your current working `config.yaml` as `config.yaml.stable`. If an experiment goes wrong — a model behaves poorly, you exhaust API credits, a provider has an outage — restore `config.yaml.stable` and run `apply-config.sh`. This pattern works whether your stable baseline is a local model or a cloud provider.


The key point: model assignment is not a permanent choice. Any agent can be switched to a different model in under 30 seconds without touching `docker-compose.yml` or fiddling with the dashboard or any other configuration.

### 3.4 Repository Structure

This repository is structured so that you can implement OpenClaw and an initial set of agents. The structure separates the OpenClaw and (if used) local model configurations -- the platform -- and the agent-specific configurations.

```
OpenClaw-Tutorial/               ← your private repo
├── spark-ai/                    ← companion public repo (submodule or clone)
│   ├── docker-compose files
│   ├── config.yaml              # model assignments — edit this
│   ├── secrets.yaml             # gitignored — API keys
│   └── apply-config.sh
└── gmail-agent/                 ← from OpenClaw-Gmail, parameterized for you
    ├── IDENTITY.md
    ├── SOUL.md
    ├── TOOLS.md
    ├── ...                      # the 8 auto-loaded files
    ├── runbooks/
    └── scripts/
```

The tutorial starts with two agents: `main` (the supervisory agent, responsible for outbox review among other duties) and `gmail-agent` (the Gmail assistant). This two-agent setup is the minimum needed to demonstrate the review workflow end-to-end.

### 3.5 Security Hardening Checklist

Done once, before connecting any external service. Four verifications before calling the platform ready:

```bash
# vLLM NOT exposed to host network
ss -ltnp | grep :8000          # must show nothing

# OpenClaw bound to Tailscale IP only
ss -tlnp | grep 18789          # must show TAILSCALE_IP:18789, not 0.0.0.0

# No SSH keys in gateway container
docker compose exec openclaw-gateway ls /home/node/.ssh   # must fail

# Sandbox container network isolation (3 DROP rules)
sudo iptables -L DOCKER-USER -n | grep DROP   # must show 3 rules
```

## Module 4 — Agent Identity: The Workspace and the Sacred-8 Files *(15 min)*

### 4.1 The Workspace
An agent's workspace is a directory of plain markdown files mounted into the OpenClaw gateway container. Everything the agent knows about itself, its user, its tools, and its duties lives in these files — readable, auditable, editable in any text editor, and version-controlled in git.

OpenClaw automatically loads eight of these files into the system prompt on every inference call for the agent. Everything else (task-specific guidance, etc.) is invisible to the model unless the agent explicitly reads it with a tool call.  These eight files define the agent's identify, personality, style, and roles.

**The Sacred Eight: files OpenClaw auto-loads (in order):**

| # | File | What it holds |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `AGENTS.md` | Sub-agent definitions and routing |
| 2 | `SOUL.md` | Persona, values, and hard behavioral invariants — the alignment document |
| 3 | `TOOLS.md` | How to invoke external tools: scripts, APIs, gog, gsuite-mcp |
| 4 | `IDENTITY.md` | Who the agent is; Slack behavior contract; list of recurring duties |
| 5 | `USER.md` | User context, preferences, communication style, and background |
| 6 | `HEARTBEAT.md` | Always-on reflexes executed on every heartbeat |
| 7 | `BOOTSTRAP.md` | First-run orientation — how to set up a fresh identity |
| 8 | `MEMORY.md` | Accumulated runtime knowledge promoted from daily memory files |

**Budget:** 20,000 characters per file; 150,000 characters total system prompt. If a file exceeds its budget, OpenClaw keeps the first 70% and last 20%.

**Everything else is NOT auto-loaded:** `CALENDAR.md`, `EMAIL.md`, `PATHS.md`, `CHANNELS.md`, runbooks, templates — invisible unless the agent reads them explicitly. More on this shortly.

### 4.2 What Each File Should (and Should Not) Contain

*Content strategy — what goes where and why — is covered here. The risks of getting it wrong (duplicated facts, drifting instructions) are treated in §4.4.*

**`SOUL.md`** holds the behavioral invariants that must hold unconditionally. If a rule must never be violated, it belongs here — not in a secondary file. Keep it focused: this is constitutional law, not policy.

**`IDENTITY.md`** describes who the agent is — its name, its Slack behavior contract, and a concise list of its recurring duties. Duties are listed here (what and when), but the how belongs in runbooks (read separately, covered in Module 6). Do not duplicate rules from SOUL.md here — reference them.

**`TOOLS.md`** is the agent's tool manual. It explains how to call each script, what arguments it takes, and what it returns. When a new script is added to the workspace, TOOLS.md gets a new entry.

**`USER.md`** holds everything the agent needs to know about you: your background, preferences, communication style, and context. This file is what makes the agent feel personal rather than generic.

**`HEARTBEAT.md`** contains only always-on reflexes — things the agent does on every heartbeat for the lifetime of the agent. Check the TODO queue for READY items. Scan for rejected emails. Infrastructure-level reflexes only. Day-of-week logic, time-window checks, and task-specific procedures do not belong here.

**`BOOTSTRAP.md`** is the first thing a fresh agent reads. It walks the agent through establishing its identity — choosing a name, filling in USER.md, understanding its tools. Best practice: make this the subject of the very first message to a new agent, before anything else. After initial setup, BOOTSTRAP.md becomes dormant orientation material.

**`MEMORY.md`** is runtime knowledge promoted from daily memory files (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`). The agent writes daily entries during conversations; important facts get promoted here for long-term retention. This is one of the two files the agent actively writes to (the other being `TODO.md`).

### 4.3 The Files That Are NOT Auto-Loaded — and Why That Matters

Several important files live in the workspace but are not auto-loaded: they reach the agent only when explicitly referenced in one of the Sacred Eight files, in a runbook or procedure, or when the agent is directly asked to read them.

**`PATHS.md`** — the canonical registry of every absolute path used by the agent: workspace root, shared directory, script locations, outbox paths. We find that path strings inevitably get duplicated across TOOLS.md, runbooks, and HEARTBEAT.md and drift out of sync as the workspace evolves. PATHS.md is the single source of truth; all other files reference it rather than hard-coding paths. The agent reads PATHS.md at the start of any task involving file I/O.

**`CHANNELS.md`** — a registry of which Slack channel maps to which agent, including channel IDs and routing rules. Needed as soon as you have more than one agent sharing a Slack workspace.

**`CALENDAR.md`** — the recurring duty schedule. Critically, this file is not read by the LLM to decide what to do — it is read by `check-todos.sh` (a bash script running on the host) to determine when to queue work for the agent. The separation is deliberate and central to the scheduling architecture in Module 5.

**`EMAIL.md`, templates, runbooks** — task-specific reference material read on demand. Because these are not auto-loaded, rules or paths that only appear in them may never reach the agent in a given session.

The implication: **anything the agent must do correctly and consistently must live in one of the 8 auto-loaded files.** Everything else is reference material.

### 4.4 The Single-Source-of-Truth Principle in Practice

One of the most insidious classes of agent configuration bug is the duplicated instruction. When the same rule, path, or fact appears in more than one file, they will eventually diverge — and the agent will silently blend contradictory signals into inconsistent behavior.

Examples of how this manifests:
- `SOUL.md` says "always get approval before sending email." `IDENTITY.md` has an older version of the same rule, phrased differently, with an implicit exception you added and forgot to add to SOUL.md. The agent interprets the combination as having a situational exception — sometimes it asks, sometimes it doesn't.
- A script path is hard-coded in `TOOLS.md`, `RUNBOOK_EMAIL_DIGEST.md`, and `HEARTBEAT.md`. The scripts directory is renamed. You update two of the three. The third silently fails on the next trigger.

The fix is architectural: **one authoritative home for each fact.** PATHS.md for paths. SOUL.md for behavioral invariants. IDENTITY.md for duties. Other files reference these — they do not repeat them.

### 4.5 How Reliably Does the Agent Follow the 8 Files?

More reliably than secondary files, but not unconditionally. This can be surprising, for instance if a template is changed and the agent uses the old template rather than the new one. There are two important nuances:

**Instructions vs. examples.** OpenClaw rebuilds the system prompt from the 8 files on every call — but it *also* sends the full session history (the accumulated back-and-forth since the last session reset). When instruction text and behavioral examples in the history conflict, examples often win. An agent with many examples of old behavior in its session history may not immediately adopt a newly-written rule, even one enshrined in SOUL.md.

**What this means for updates.** Updating a file on disk does not guarantee the agent immediately adopts the new behavior. Any behavioral change requires four steps: (1) edit the right file, (2) reset the session to clear counter-examples from history, (3) explicitly tell the agent about the change in the first message of the new session, (4) verify the next execution follows the new rule.

**Reliability tiers:**

| Source | When agent sees it | Reliability |
|---|---|---|
| One of the 8 auto-loaded files | Every inference call | High — with session reset after changes |
| Non-auto-loaded file | Only when agent explicitly reads it | Indeterminate |
| A runbook (read at trigger time) | Fresh from disk on every trigger | Most reliable for procedural changes |
| Session history examples | Every call until session reset | Works against you after behavioral changes |

## Module 5 — Scheduling: The Shell Owns the Clock *(12 min)*

### 5.1 The Core Principle

> **The decision of when to act is always owned by deterministic code. The act of doing the work is owned by the LLM. These two responsibilities must never be mixed.**

An LLM has no clock. It has no reliable memory of having acted in a previous session. If you ask it to decide whether it is time to run a task, it will reason through that question every time it runs — and it will sometimes be wrong.

### 5.2 The Token-Waste Problem

A 15-minute heartbeat fires **672 times per week**. If `HEARTBEAT.md` instructs the agent to check whether it's time to run a weekly report, the agent reasons through that question 672 times — and acts on 1 of them:

| Task frequency | Heartbeats/week | Useful fires | Wasted LLM calls |
|---|---|---|---|
| Once a week | 672 | 1 | 671 (99.9% waste) |
| Mon + Thu | 672 | 2 | 670 (99.7% waste) |
| Weekdays at 9am | 672 | 5 | 667 (99.3% waste) |

Beyond token cost: the agent must remember whether it already ran the task today — state that does not survive a session reset. LLM-driven scheduling fires twice, then not at all, then twice again.

### 5.3 Three Tiers of Scheduling

| Tier | File | Owned by | Lifecycle | Use for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Always-on | `HEARTBEAT.md` | Human | Permanent | Infrastructure reflexes on every heartbeat |
| Recurring | `CALENDAR.md` | Human | Season or project | Day-of-week, daily, monthly recurring tasks |
| One-shot | `TODO.md` | Agent (at runtime) | Ad hoc | Single deferred tasks written during a conversation |

**The human analogy:** HEARTBEAT.md is brushing your teeth — every day, forever, no thought required. CALENDAR.md is "send the Monday/Thursday reports through June." TODO.md is "call the dentist" or "pick up eggs."

**The critical distinction for TODO.md vs. CALENDAR.md:** If a task needs to happen again next week, it belongs in CALENDAR.md. An agent that re-schedules recurring tasks by writing new TODO.md entries will lose track of them after a session reset — they disappear silently.

**What is a session?** In OpenClaw, a session is a conversation history file (`.jsonl`) stored in the gateway's persistent Docker volume. Each agent maintains its own session; within that, different Slack channels and the heartbeat each have their own sub-session. A session accumulates every exchange — user messages, agent responses, tool calls, and results — as an append-only log. Crucially, sessions survive gateway restarts: when the gateway comes back up, it picks up the history where it left off.

**Session reset** is not a native OpenClaw operation — it is our addition. OpenClaw never resets sessions on its own; they grow indefinitely. Our `reset-sessions.sh` script (run nightly via cron) archives any session file larger than 512 KB and truncates it to zero. The agent starts fresh on the next heartbeat, reading its identity and context from the Sacred Eight files rather than from accumulated history. When you deliberately change agent behavior, you should reset the relevant session immediately rather than waiting for the nightly job.

**Why HEARTBEAT.md must be stable:** Beyond the token-efficiency argument (the 672-heartbeats-per-week table), HEARTBEAT.md is consulted on every heartbeat for the lifetime of the agent. A mistake introduced while editing it — a typo, a malformed step, a removed closing line — can silently impair or disable the agent's core reflexes until caught and corrected. Keep HEARTBEAT.md lean and stable: infrastructure reflexes only, never task-specific procedures. Those belong in runbooks, where they can be changed without risking the heartbeat loop.

### 5.4 The Scheduling Engine: check-todos.sh

**File formats:**

```
# CALENDAR.md — human-authored, never modified by scripts or agents
MON,THU 14:00 | Send notifications per runbooks/RUNBOOK_NOTIFICATIONS.md

# TODO.md — agent writes one-shots; check-todos.sh promotes to READY
# Agent writes a one-shot:
2026-04-07T18:00:00Z | Follow up with Jones re: proposal

# check-todos.sh promotes it (replaces the line in-place):
READY | 2026-04-07T18:00:00Z | Follow up with Jones re: proposal

# check-todos.sh also appends recurring items from CALENDAR.md:
READY | 2026-04-07T14:00:00Z | Send notifications per runbooks/RUNBOOK_NOTIFICATIONS.md
```

**The execution flow — precisely:**

```
check-todos.sh  (cron, every 5 min, zero tokens)
  ├─ Reads CALENDAR.md
  │    For each entry: is it due today/now AND not already fired today?
  │    (checks shared/todos/calendar-state.json for last-fired timestamp)
  │    If due: appends  READY | <timestamp> | <task>  to TODO.md
  │    Updates calendar-state.json. CALENDAR.md is never modified.
  │
  └─ Reads TODO.md
       For each timestamp line: is the time past?
       If yes: rewrites that line in-place as  READY | <timestamp> | <task>

OpenClaw heartbeat  (every 15 min, tokens only when READY lines exist)
  └─ Agent reads TODO.md, looks for lines beginning with READY
       ├─ None found → replies HEARTBEAT_OK  (fast, minimal tokens)
       └─ READY line found → executes the task per its runbook
            → removes the completed line from TODO.md
            → logs the completed task to shared/todos/todo.log
```

CALENDAR.md is never touched by the script or the agent — it is the human-authored source of recurring duties. TODO.md is the runtime queue: the script promotes entries into it, the agent executes and removes them. *(Note: the agent removing its own completed lines is an area flagged for improvement — see FIXES.md.)*

**State tracking:** `check-todos.sh` records last-fired timestamps in `shared/todos/calendar-state.json` on the host — not in the agent's memory. Deduplication survives session resets.

### 5.5 Session Management

OpenClaw replays the full conversation history on every inference call. As session history grows, latency grows — not because of context size per se, but because of unbounded growth in the history file.

**Prefill vs. generation** — a nuance worth understanding: LLM generation (output tokens) runs sequentially at perhaps 50-100 tps on a reasonably capable local GPU. Prefill (processing the input — system prompt + history) runs in parallel across all input tokens and is much faster: 10,000 tokens prefill in ~1–3 seconds. Session history is the real latency risk because it grows without a hard cap, while the system prompt is bounded at 150K characters.


### 5.6 The Host-Side Crontab

All scheduling and session management runs on the host as cron jobs — never inside any container. Crontab supports comment lines, so the entries are grouped by purpose:

```
TZ=America/Chicago

# ── Scheduling engine (see §5.4) ─────────────────────────────────────────────
*/5  * * * *  check-todos.sh           # promote due CALENDAR entries and past-due
                                        # TODO entries to READY; zero LLM tokens

# ── Outbox processing (see §2.5) ─────────────────────────────────────────────
*/30 * * * *  send-approved-emails.sh  # send approved outbox drafts via Gmail API;
                                        # move to sent/; archive rejected/

# ── Session management (see §5.5) ────────────────────────────────────────────
*/5  * * * *  monitor-sessions.sh      # log session .jsonl sizes every 5 min;
                                        # alert if approaching reset threshold
0    3 * * *  reset-sessions.sh        # archive sessions >512KB, truncate to zero;
                                        # agent restarts clean from Sacred Eight files
*/30 * * * *  seed-sessions.sh         # restore missing heartbeat session files
                                        # after gateway restarts
```

Nothing in this crontab requires the LLM to be running. The scheduling engine, outbox sender, and session manager all operate independently of whether any agent is active.

## Module 6 — Separation of Responsibilities: Runbooks, Scripts, and Cron *(10 min)*

### 6.1 The Three-Layer Pattern in Practice

The layered architecture from §2.3 is now concrete. The LLM sits atop three deterministic layers; this module describes those three layers and how they work together.

| Layer | Location | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **LLM** | OpenClaw gateway | Judgment, composition, language — invokes runbooks for procedural tasks |
| **Runbooks** | `agent/runbooks/RUNBOOK_*.md` | Step-by-step procedures: which scripts to call, in what order, with what arguments, and what to do with the output |
| **Scripts** | `agents/scripts/*.py`, `*.sh` | Deterministic work: fetch, transform, count, route, call APIs, return structured results |
| **Cron** | Host crontab | Decides when: promotes READY items, sends approved outputs, manages sessions |

The LLM never decides when to act. Cron never decides what to say. Scripts never decide what action to take — they execute deterministically and return results. Each layer does only what belongs to it.

### 6.2 Runbooks: Procedures the Agent Follows

A runbook is a markdown file in the agent's `runbooks/` directory. It gives step-by-step instructions for a specific recurring task and is read **fresh from disk on every trigger** — not held in session memory. This makes runbooks the most reliable vehicle for procedural changes: edit the runbook, and the very next trigger follows the new procedure exactly.

**The three-file pattern for any new recurring duty:**
1. One line in `IDENTITY.md` — what the duty is and its trigger
2. One runbook file `runbooks/RUNBOOK_X.md` — how to execute it step by step
3. One line in `CALENDAR.md` — when to trigger it (read by bash, not the LLM)

**Example: RUNBOOK_EMAIL_DIGEST.md**
- Triggered: daily at 08:00 AM Central (via CALENDAR.md → check-todos.sh → HEARTBEAT.md)
- Step 1: Read `PATHS.md` to confirm all file paths
- Step 2: Run `scripts/gmail_api.py --query "in:inbox after:yesterday"` → returns JSON list of messages
- Step 3: Run `scripts/contacts_api.py --lookup` on each sender → identifies known contacts
- Step 4: LLM composes digest from the results, formats for email
- Step 5: Write draft to outbox (pending approval) or send directly per standing authorization

Steps 1–3 are deterministic. Step 4 is where the LLM earns its keep. Step 5 follows the outbox pattern.

### 6.3 Scripts: Deterministic Tools for the Agent

Scripts are registered tools — the agent calls them via `exec` inside the sandbox, reads the output, and acts on it. They are invoked by runbooks, not by HEARTBEAT.md directly.

Key properties of well-designed agent scripts:
- **No LLM dependency** — the script does not call the model. It fetches, transforms, counts, or routes.
- **Structured output** — returns JSON the LLM can reliably parse
- **No third-party dependencies if avoidable** — `gmail_api.py` uses Python stdlib + `urllib` only; no pip install in the sandbox
- **Single responsibility** — one script, one job. The LLM composes multiple script calls; scripts do not compose each other.

**Example scripts from the worked example:**
- `gmail_api.py` — search and fetch email via Gmail API; stdlib only
- `contacts_api.py` — search and create contacts via Google People API; stdlib only
- `notify.py` — compose and queue outbox email; calls LLM API directly for composition

---

## Module 7 — Integrations: Slack and Google *(8 min)*

### 7.1 Slack

**Setup requirements:**
- Slack app at api.slack.com/apps with Socket Mode enabled
- Bot scopes: `channels:history`, `chat:write`, `users:read`, `groups:history` (do not add `assistant:write`)
- Bot token and app token added to `openclaw.json` under `channels.slack`
- CHANNELS.md updated with the channel ID → agent mapping

**Routing multiple agents:** When you have more than one agent, OpenClaw uses `bindings` in `openclaw.json` to route specific Slack channels to specific agents. One agent is marked `"default": true` and handles all DMs and unrouted messages. CHANNELS.md tracks the mapping in a human-readable form so you are not hunting through JSON when you forget which channel ID is which.

**The outbound post problem:** Agents can reply within active Slack sessions. They cannot initiate a post to a channel when no session is active (e.g., a scheduled overnight summary). The **slack-outbox pattern** handles this identically to email:
- Agent writes JSON to `shared/slack-outbox/` (channel, text, status: "pending")
- `send-slack-posts.sh` (cron, every 5 minutes) posts via `chat.postMessage` and archives

### 7.2 Google — Two Integration Paths

We use two different tools to reach Google services, for specific reasons:

| Tool | Best for | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `gsuite-mcp` | Gmail, Google Contacts | OAuth browser flow; writes `token.json`; works well with `messages.list` API |
| `gog` CLI | Google Sheets, Docs, Drive | Better for bulk read/write operations on structured documents |

**Why not one tool for everything?** We found that `gog` uses `threads.list` for Gmail, which returns only the first message of a thread and ignores `in:sent` filters — making it unsuitable for inbox and sent-mail workflows. `gsuite-mcp` handles OAuth and token refresh cleanly; our scripts (`gmail_api.py`, `contacts_api.py`) read the token it writes and call the Gmail API directly via `urllib`. For Drive and Sheets, `gog` is more capable and is the better fit. If `gsuite-mcp` gains full Drive/Sheets support in the future, consolidating to one tool would be worth revisiting.

**Credential handling in the sandbox:** OAuth tokens and credential files must be bind-mounted into the agent's sandbox container. Scripts must be mounted read-only; token files must be writable (for refresh). These mounts are configured in `openclaw.json` per agent.

**Google Cloud setup prerequisites** (students do this before the lab):
- Create a Google Cloud project
- Enable the APIs you need: Gmail, People, Drive, Sheets as applicable
- Configure OAuth consent screen and download credentials JSON
- Run `gsuite-mcp auth login` (browser flow, one time) to generate `token.json`

## Module 8 — Lessons Learned *(5 min)*

These are not setup checklists or incident reports. Each is a general principle extracted from a specific problem — the kind of lesson that applies beyond the exact incident that generated it.

---

**Lesson 1: Agents need a single source of truth for every fact**

The general principle: any fact, rule, or path that appears in more than one file will eventually diverge. The agent sees all 8 system-prompt files simultaneously and will silently blend contradictory signals into inconsistent, unpredictable behavior.

How it manifests:
- A behavioral rule stated in SOUL.md is also stated, slightly differently, in IDENTITY.md. You refine one and forget the other. The agent begins to behave as if there is a situational exception — because the two versions imply one.
- A file path is hard-coded in TOOLS.md, a runbook, and HEARTBEAT.md. You rename the scripts directory. You update two of the three. The third silently fails on every trigger until you notice.

The fix: establish canonical ownership for every category of fact. PATHS.md owns all file paths — every other file references it. SOUL.md owns behavioral invariants — IDENTITY.md lists duties but defers to SOUL.md for rules. Write each fact once; reference it everywhere else.

---

**Lesson 2: Agents have no clock and no memory of having acted**

The general principle: a language model has no internal sense of time passing and no persistent memory across session resets. Any scheduling or recurrence logic embedded in the agent's identity files will be checked on every heartbeat, burning tokens on hundreds of no-ops, and will fail silently after a session reset wipes the agent's memory of when it last acted.

How it manifests:
- HEARTBEAT.md instructs the agent to "check if it's Monday and, if so, send the weekly report." The agent faithfully evaluates this condition 672 times a week, costs tokens on 671 non-Monday heartbeats, and has no reliable way to know whether it already sent the report earlier that day.
- After a session reset, the agent has no memory of tasks it completed in the previous session. A recurring task scheduled via TODO.md disappears permanently unless it was also added to CALENDAR.md.

The fix: shell owns the clock. CALENDAR.md defines recurring duties in a format that `check-todos.sh` reads and acts on deterministically. TODO.md is for one-shot tasks only. The agent is invoked only when work is ready — it never decides when to act.

---

**Lesson 3: Session history can override freshly-written instructions**

The general principle: the LLM does not treat system-prompt instructions and session-history examples as separate inputs with different authority. When examples of old behavior in the session history outnumber or contradict new instructions in the .md files, the examples often win. Updating a file on disk does not immediately change agent behavior.

How it manifests:
- You add "always queue email for approval before sending" to SOUL.md. The session history contains 15 examples of the agent sending email directly. The agent continues to send directly — the instruction is outvoted.
- You update IDENTITY.md to change the Slack output format. The agent's next several responses use the old format. The new format appears only after a session reset.

The fix: any behavioral change requires four steps in sequence — (1) edit the right file, (2) immediately reset the session history, (3) tell the agent explicitly in the first message of the fresh session, (4) verify the next execution. Skipping step 2 is the most common error.

---

**Lesson 4: Agents will try to "help" unless you explicitly bound what help means**

The general principle: language models are trained to be helpful and will extend that helpfulness beyond the scope you intended unless you define boundaries explicitly. When debugging a problem, the agent will not just diagnose — it will also propose fixes, and if it has the tools, it will execute them on things you did not ask it to touch.

How it manifests:
- You ask the agent to help diagnose a Slack message formatting issue. It reads `openclaw.json`, concludes the channel configuration is wrong, and proposes to update it. One poorly-worded response later and config writes have been attempted on the gateway — potentially crashing it.
- You ask the agent to review a failing cron script. It fixes the script (correctly), then refactors two adjacent scripts "while it's at it," introducing a subtle bug.

The fix: disable `commands.config` writes immediately after onboarding — before connecting any external channel. Put explicit "diagnose and report; do not attempt fixes without explicit instruction" rules in SOUL.md for infrastructure domains. Run all execution in sandbox so the blast radius of enthusiastic self-correction is contained.

---

**Lesson 5: The outbox is not optional for external communications**

The general principle: the first time an agent sends something on your behalf that you did not intend, you understand viscerally why the outbox pattern exists. Every external communication with real-world consequences — email sent, Slack post published, API mutation made — should go through a queue, human review, and deterministic execution.

How it manifests:
- An agent drafts and sends a "helpful" follow-up email to a contact who appeared in your inbox in an ambiguous context. The email is well-written and completely wrong for the situation. It cannot be unsent.
- A scheduled overnight summary task runs, and the agent's interpretation of "summarize" is slightly off. The result goes directly to a team Slack channel at 6am. Forty people see it before you wake up.

The fix: agent writes to `outbox/` with status `pending`. Nothing sends until status is set to `approved` — by a human, or by a designated supervisor agent operating under its own SOUL.md constraints. A deterministic cron script sends approved items and archives everything. The audit trail in `sent/` and `rejected/` gives you a complete record.

---

**Lesson 6: Sandbox is structural, not optional hardening**

The general principle: running agent code inside an ephemeral sandbox container is not a cautious choice for worried operators — it is the architectural guarantee that agent execution cannot affect the host filesystem, persist state between runs, or reach network resources you have not explicitly authorized. It should be enabled before the agent is given any tools. The research community has reached the same conclusion: Shankar et al. (2025) identify containment and runtime monitoring as essential requirements — not optional hardening — for any agent system with tool access. [*cite: "Agentic AI Security: Threats, Defenses, Evaluation, and Open Challenges," arXiv 2510.23883, 2025*]

How it manifests:
- Gateway-exec mode (the alternative to sandbox) runs agent commands directly on the host as your user. A script with a path bug writes to the wrong location on your host filesystem. There is no container boundary to catch it.
- A sandbox container misconfigured with an overly broad network bind-mount can reach services beyond its intended scope. Catching this early with iptables DOCKER-USER rules prevents the misconfiguration from becoming an incident.

The fix: set `sandbox.mode = "all"` in `openclaw.json` before connecting any external service. Add iptables DOCKER-USER rules to block sandbox containers from reaching your LAN, Tailscale network, or SSH. Verify with the four-command security checklist before calling the platform ready.

## What's Next: The Hands-On Lab

The hands-on session (developed separately as its own document in this repository) uses the materials in this repo directly — no external clones required. The tutorial repo will be organized as:

```
OpenClaw-Tutorial/
├── gateway/          # platform configuration (docker-compose, config.yaml, scripts)
│                     # derived from spark-ai; updated and parameterized for tutorial use
└── agents/           # agent workspace template
                      # derived from OpenClaw-Gmail; ready to parameterize and deploy
```

Students clone `OpenClaw-Tutorial`, configure their model path, and work entirely within this single repo. The lecture you just completed provides the full conceptual foundation — the lab is execution.

Students will:
1. Clone the tutorial repo; choose local or cloud model path; configure `config.yaml` and `secrets.yaml`; run `apply-config.sh`
2. Apply security hardening and verify the four-command checklist
3. Complete Google Cloud and OAuth setup (gsuite-mcp) — prerequisite steps done before lab day
4. Set up the Slack app and configure channel routing
5. Parameterize the agent workspace (one substitution pass through `agents/`)
6. Install the host-side crontab and observe `check-todos.sh` promote a calendar entry to READY
7. Practice the behavioral change lock-in procedure: edit → reset → tell → verify
8. Walk through an outbox approval cycle end-to-end

*The hands-on lab will be developed as a separate document (`HANDS-ON.md`) in this repository, structured for independent self-paced use or instructor-led delivery. The `gateway/` and `agents/` directories will be populated by harvesting and updating the relevant files from the reference repositories used to develop this curriculum.*
